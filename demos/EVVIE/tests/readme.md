# EVVIE Tests
We provide a few resources for further understanding how EVVIE works and performing tests.

- [API Documentation](./endpoints.md) - read about the EVVIE ASP.NET API to understand the endpoints available and their input/output schemas.
- [Sample Images](./sample-images/) - since EVVIE primarily works with images encoded in base64 format, we provide some sample photos in base64 for you to easily grab and test.
