## üß† How It Works

1. **Multiple Case Origin Channels**  
   Citizens can submit inquiries via:
   - Email  
   - Web forms  
   - Scanned letters, PDFs, or paper forms  
   - Fax or fillable forms  
   - Live chat or phone (transcription)

2. **AI-Powered Parsing**  
   A Power Automate flow triggers a **Custom Prompt** model in **AI Builder** to extract:
   - Customer name  
   - Case number or topic  
   - Confidence score  
   - Any relevant metadata

3. **Case Creation**  
   - Extracted data is used to **automatically create a new case** in Dynamics 365.
   - Based on the model‚Äôs confidence, the case can either be auto-routed or flagged for agent verification.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Agent Workflow

Cases created via the Correspondence Processor appear directly in the **Customer Service Workspace** for agent triage and response:

- Filter by AI Confidence Level  
- Review generated case summaries  
- Work from prefilled data or make corrections  
- Proceed to resolution and closure
