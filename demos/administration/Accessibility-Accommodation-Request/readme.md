![acr screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6DLNBLT.png)
This solution contains two applications (canvas and model) to support the tracking of accessibility accommodation requests. This solution can be leveraged by:
 - Employees to request an accommodation request via a canvas app.  
 - Managers to review and approve the accommodations request

## Note
The canvas app is designed with a fixed phone form factor and does not use responsive design.  The app does utilize various Power Platfoorm accessibility features to support screen readers such as Accessible Labels and Roles.  The app also features a font size zoom capability.
