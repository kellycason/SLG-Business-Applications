# ðŸŒ± Department of Environment / Environmental Quality Demos
The Environment category features demos and solutions dedicated to helping State and Local Government agencies protect natural resources, monitor ecosystem health, and promote sustainability using smart technology. These applications harness the power of AI, IoT devices, and data analytics to automate wildlife monitoring, track air quality, and turn raw environmental observations into actionable intelligence. The aim is to give governments modern tools for responsible stewardshipâ€”making it easier to understand and respond to environmental challenges, safeguard public health, and support science-backed decisions for future generations.

- [Animal Identification](./Animal-Identification/): Automatically analyze wildlife camera trap photos with AI to identify species, count individuals, estimate age categories, and classify animal sexâ€”enabling scalable, accurate monitoring of animal populations, diversity, and movement patterns for conservation and management.
- [Environmental Air Quality Monitoring](./Environmental-Air-Quality-Monitoring/): Collect, visualize, and report environmental air quality data from IoT sensors (using Raspberry Pi and specialized sensors), process the data through Power Automate and Dataverse, display readings in Power Apps and Power BI dashboards, and serve live data via APIâ€”empowering governments to track ambient air quality, protect public health, and meet regulatory standards.
