## ‚ùì What Problem Are We Solving?

Copilot Studio is a powerful tool for building Generative AI agents that reason over your data. However, **permissions are often all-or-nothing**, meaning users either have full control over an agent or none at all.

We've heard from several state and local government entities that they need a **delegated authority model**‚Äîspecifically, the ability to allow users to manage **file-based knowledge sources only**, without granting full agent control.

---

## üîÑ Is There Another Option?

You might ask: *Why not use SharePoint as a knowledge source and delegate content management there?*

While valid, this approach has two key limitations:
- **Indexing and search quality**: Files uploaded directly to Copilot Studio are indexed and searched by Dataverse, which may outperform SharePoint.
- **Authentication**: SharePoint requires Entra ID, making it unsuitable for public-facing agents.

---

## üí° Our Solution

We built a Power Platform-based solution that acts as an **admin console** for managing file-based knowledge sources in Copilot Studio.

### Key Features:
- Select an agent
- View existing knowledge files
- Add or remove files
- Reflect changes in Copilot Studio

This is enabled through a Power App and supporting components included in the [unmanaged solution file](https://github.com/microsoft/SLG-Business-Applications/releases/download/41/CopilotStudioknowledgemanager_1_0_0_2.zip).

## üöÄ How to Deploy

1. Download the [unmanaged solution file](https://github.com/microsoft/SLG-Business-Applications/releases/download/41/CopilotStudioknowledgemanager_1_0_0_2.zip).
2. Open Power Apps and navigate to your **non-production environment**.
3. Import the solution.
4. Assign the required security roles (see below).
5. Launch the app and start managing knowledge sources.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Only **file-based knowledge sources** are supported.
- Other knowledge types (e.g., websites, SharePoint) are not included.
- The app does **not publish agents**‚Äîthis must be done manually in Copilot Studio. In the app, new files are tagged as **Draft** until the agent is published.

---

## üîê Security Roles and Permissions

To use this app, users need:
- **Solution Customizer** (standard role)
- **Copilot Studio Knowledge Manager** (custom role included in the solution)

> Note: Copilot Studio components are "Solution Components" in Dataverse, requiring elevated permissions to modify (hence the need for the Solution Cusomizer role).

---

## üß© Other Solution Components

The solution also includes a **Power Automate flow** that sends a Teams notification to the agent owner whenever a new file is added.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending This Solution

This is an **unmanaged solution**, so you're free to customize it!

Ideas for extension:
- Add a **Publish** function (see: [How To Add Copilot Studio Knowledge Files Using Power Automate](https://www.matthewdevaney.com/how-to-add-copilot-studio-knowledge-files-using-power-automate/#Publish-The-Copilot-Studio-Agent-Using-A-Bound-Action))
- Build a **review/approval workflow**
- Integrate with other Power Platform tools

Let your creativity guide you‚ÄîPower Platform is your playground!
