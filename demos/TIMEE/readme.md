# ðŸ•’ TIMEE: AI-Powered **Time**sheet **E**ntry Agent
TIMEE, pronouned *Timmy*, is a conversational agent that transforms how organizations handle timesheet reporting. Instead of wrestling with rigid, manual entry systems, staff can simply talk to TIMEE - an intuitive AI chatbot built to understand natural language descriptions of work activities.

Just describe your week, and TIMEE takes care of the rest: interpreting your input, auto-filling the timesheet, and allowing further refinement through follow-up chat. Submit with confidence and skip the hassle.

TIMEE is powered by Microsoft Power Platform and Azure AI Foundry, leveraging scalable cloud technologies and advanced AI capabilities to streamline operational workflows and enhance user experience.

## Two Agents:
- Agent 1 = TIMEE
    - Conversational
    - Role = chat with the user about their timesheet needs.
    - Collect all relevant information
    - Then provide all relevant information to the next agent...
    - Has "**Generate Time Sheet**" tool for calling to time sheet generator
- Agent 2 = Timesheet Generator Agent
    - Role = **only generate a timesheet from a single input**
    - System prompt = elaborate prompt + structure specified
    - User prompt = description of timesheet needs as TIMEE
    - Outputs timesheet as JSON, outputs it + is handled programmatically
    - Responds "the user is now seeing the timesheet you specified" to TIMEE
