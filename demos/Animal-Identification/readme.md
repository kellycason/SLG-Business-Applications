# AI-Powered Wildlife Monitoring System
This system uses advanced AI-driven image analysis to automatically process photographs from wildlife game cameras. It identifies animals, counts individuals, determines species, estimates age groups, and classifies sex, all without manual review.

By turning raw camera trap images into structured, actionable data, State Government Wildlife Departments can monitor wildlife populations at scale, track changes over time, and make informed conservation and management decisions.

## How It Works
1. Image Collection – Game cameras capture photos in the field.
2. Analysis – The system processes each image to:
    - Detect and identify animal species
    - Count the number of individuals present
    - Estimate age categories (juvenile, sub-adult, adult)
    - Determine sex (male, female, unknown)
3. Data Aggregation – Results are stored in a secure database for analysis.
4. Reporting & Insights – Dashboards and reports provide trends, alerts, and summaries.

## Use Cases for State Government
This system can deliver wildlife insights by tracking species diversity, population changes, seasonal movements, and age/sex ratios, while also detecting unusual patterns such as sudden declines or invasive species. Together, these metrics provide a clear picture of ecosystem health and support informed conservation decisions.

Below are some possible uses for this system:

- **Population Monitoring** – Track species abundance and distribution over time.
- **Conservation Planning** – Identify at-risk species and prioritize habitat protection.
- **Wildlife Management** – Support hunting quotas, relocation programs, and breeding initiatives.
- **Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation** – Detect patterns of animal movement near human settlements.
- **Policy & Research Support** – Provide reliable, data-backed evidence for legislation and academic studies.

## Why This Matters
Manual review of wildlife camera images is time-consuming and prone to human error. This AI system automates the process, enabling faster, more accurate, and more consistent monitoring. The result is better data, better decisions, and better outcomes for wildlife conservation.
